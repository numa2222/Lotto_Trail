# Lotto_Trail
Guys! I first tried to make Lotto Game.
Guys this game, Since long time, I was working and I am upto this point. I started it while I was learning Java. And got bit frusted with complexity  of coding .This game has many flaws, mainly still repeats numbers. In real world Lotto game result does not allow to repeat numbers.So any enthusiadtic fork it N develop it. where I left it.I am not giving it up though. Good luck, I love to see better version of it. Thank you.May Lord Bless You. So long!!!
